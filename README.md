# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024

## Information

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles in Advent of Code 2024.

## How to try out

```console
$ git clone 'https://github.com/poffomoe/aoc-2024'
$ cd aoc-2024
$ mkdir input
```

Then place the input files of each day in the `input` directory with the following names: `day_1`, `day_2`, `day_3`, `..`, `day_25`.

After you've done that, you can run solutions of each day using

```console
$ cargo run -p day_X
```
